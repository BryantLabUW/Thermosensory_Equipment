# Thermosensory_Equipment
Materials and code for custom thermosensation equipment in the Bryant Lab

Contains documentation for:  
- a large format thermotaxis arena, similar to the version described in Bryant *et al* 2018 (DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2018.05.063).  
- a microscope-mounted thermal stimulator, similar to the version described in Bryant *et al* 2022 (DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2022.04.010).  

Code Notes:  
- For up-to-date *post-hoc* analysis code for the large format thermotaxis arena, please see the [WormTracker3000 repository on GitHub](https://github.com/astrasb/WormTracker3000).
- For up-to-date analysis code for fluorescent biosensor imaging using the microscope-mounted thermal stimulator, please see the [BryantLabUW Biosensory_Imaging_Codebase repository](https://github.com/BryantLabUW/Biosensor_Imaging_Codebase).
